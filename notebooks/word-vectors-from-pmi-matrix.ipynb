There are many other ways to create word vectors, but matrix decomposition is one of the most straightforward.  A well cited description of the technique used in this notebook can be found in Chris Moody's blog post [Stop Using word2vec](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2017/10/18/stop-using-word2vec/).    If you are interested in reading further about the history of word embeddings and a discussion of modern approaches check out the following blog post by Sebastian Ruder, [An overview of word embeddings and their connection to distributional semantic models](http://blog.aylien.com/overview-word-embeddings-history-word2vec-cbow-glove/).  Especially interesting to me is the work by Omar Levy, Yoav Goldberg, and Ido Dagan which shows that tuning hyperparameters is as (if not more) important as the algorithm chosen to build word vectors. [Improving Distributional Similarity with Lessons Learned from Word Embeddings](https://transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/570).\n","\n","We will be using the [\"A Million News Headlines\"](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines) dataset which contains headlines published over a period of 15 years from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n","It is a great clean corpus that is large enough to be interesting and small enough to allow for quick calculations.  In this notebook tutorial we will implement as much as we can without using libraries that obfuscate the algorithm.  We're not going to write our own linear algebra or sparse matrix routines, but we will calculate unigram frequency, skipgram frequency, and the pointwise mutual information matrix \"by hand\".  Hopefully this will make the method easier to understand!
